**BLOOD GROUP IDENTIFICATION**


**INTRODUCTION**

The project aims to automate the identification of blood groups by combining Django, a robust web framework, with OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library, to analyze blood sample images efficiently and accurately. OpenCV is employed to process and interpret images of blood tests, identifying the ABO and Rh blood groups, while Django provides a user-friendly web interface for uploading images and viewing results. By streamlining blood group identification, the system minimizes human error, speeds up the process, and offers a scalable solution for medical diagnostics and blood donation systems.

  
**CUSTOMER FEATURES**

1.	Create a new user account to access the application
2.	Login with your username and password 
3.	Input for Uploading an Image 
4.	Output to display the Identified Blood Group

**MILESTONES**

1.	The system allows users to create an account on the registration page, log in to their account to access the profile page, and upload images on the profile page for          identification.
2.	Implemented OpenCV functions to process and analyze the images, determining the basic conditions for identifying the blood type.
3.	Implemented the functions to process and display the uploaded images on the web page with contours.
4.	Executed morphological operations to structure the uploaded images, performed agglutination analysis, and identified the blood type.
